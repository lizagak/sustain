	  <h3 style="font-size: 26pt">Hi there! I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>.</h3>
	  <h3><p>I am an fifth year PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">School of Information</a> at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a>, where I am advised by <a href="http://www.niloufar.org">Dr. Niloufar Salehi</a>. I am currently on the job market for postdoc and industry positions!</p>
	<p> Most recently, I published <strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03200">The Distressing Ads That Persist: Uncovering The Harms of Targeted Weight-Loss Ads Among Users with Histories of Disordered Eating</a> </strong> at <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/2022/">CSCW 2022</a>. 
	  <p>I am interested broadly in human-computer interaction, online harms, social and relational aspects of privacy, and interpersonal surveillance. I use interviews, ethnography, speculative design, and participatory action research methods to engage young people as co-researchers in reflecting on their everyday experiences with technology. My research has been generously funded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSF-GRFP">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship</a>, the <a href="https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/">Center for Technology, Society, and Policy</a>, and the <a href="https://afog.berkeley.edu/">Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Group</a>. At Berkeley, I've had the pleasure of teaching <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/188">INFO 188: Behind the Data - Humans and Values</a> with <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/deirdre-mulligan">Prof. Deirdre Mulligan</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/203">INFO 203: Social Issues of Information</a> with <a href="http://morganya.org">Dr. Morgan Ames</a>.  In the past, I have worked at Meta, AT&T, and US Bank. </p>
	  <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.wustl.edu">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and American Culture Studies. In undergrad, I worked with <a href="https://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/karriekarahalios.html">Dr. Karrie Karahalios</a> and <a href="https://ranjithakumar.net/">Dr. Ranjitha Kumar</a> at the <a href="https://www.illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>.</p>
	  <br>Outside of work, you can find me playing tennis, building my latest stained glass piece, volunteering as a concert usher, and organizing Yiddish culture events across the Bay Area. Contact me at <a href="http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}">@{{ site.twitter }}</a> or by <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a>. My CV is available upon request.</h3>
